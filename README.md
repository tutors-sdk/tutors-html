# tutors-html

A HTML generator for the tutors reader:

- <https://github.com/edeleastar/tutors-design>

This project will build a static web site locally. To see it in action:

```
git clone https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-starter.git
npx tutors-html
```

This will generate a web site in ./public-site.

The design of the system is discussed here:
